<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. I started out as an Engineering major, hoping to get more into product design and development. Soon after classes started, I realized that Engineering was not for me and that I had more of a love for design and art. This passion struck me to change my major and now I am getting a Bachelors' of Science in Architecture, with a Studio Arts minor and a Sustainability certificate. I learned through this process that sometimes life does not go the way that you planned for it and it is okay to get lost in the weeds of life, it is just a part of it all.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>Looking at my experiences, I would say that all throughout highschool and from my first two years of college, I have learned how to design and how to make my design appeal to the specific audience. As an Architect, you have to design for the client and that is something that I want to make sure I do in my future practice. I think it is really important to make sure that a client knows that they have a voice in what they really need and want from my work. As I have grown up, I realized that I am most definitely a maker, I seem to learn best hands on than anything else. I would say that my preferred medium is pencil, to sketch, but my runner up would have to be either Illustrator or AutoCad. Pencil and paper interest me because it is not used in practice much anymore which is kind of sad becuase I think it is beautiful and impressive to be able to show someone your ideas, by drawing it out. Society has lost the pencil and paper idea and has jumped to everything electronically. This is why I like Illustrator and AutoCad, because it is what we now are based out of as architects and they have great features that make your work exceptional, if you know how to use it right. I wish to learn a lot more about animation and how to work that, I also want to learn a little more about graphic design.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly are you into? Take some time to explain your interest...what you will pursue in this class. What is it, define it, why is it important/significant, how do you intend to approach this subject matter?-->

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>Something that I am personally interested in is sustainable Architecture. Sustainable Architecture is designing Architecture with the Earth and its entirety in mind. Some ways to make sustainable Architecture is using solar panels, rainwater reuse systems, green roofs, etc. This is an idea that I could use for this class to make an interactive sustainable house with pop-ups that teach users about this and how they can make small efforts to make their life more 'green'. I think that everyone needs to start getting a greener lifestyle and making a good impact on the world. If we do not start now, what is our world going to look like in 10 years? The main problem about this is that people are not aware of what they are doing and their impact. We need to start teaching, rather than criticizing. </h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After I graduate, I plan to get either an internship or a job at an Architecture firm or a furniture design company. I then plan to work for a semester to a year and hope that the job that I am working at will want to pay for Grad school. After two years at Grad school for a Masters in Architecture and Furniture Design, my dream would be to be an Architect for Disney World, but if that does not work out any firm would be amazing. I would also like to be an Architecture Studio professor at a college. My reasoning for going on this path is because design is something that I know I want to continue in. I think Architecture and design was sparked from my interest in art throughout my younger years and how my mother and grandmother are very talented crafters all their lives. Looking back at my early years, I dont remember a time where my mother was not crocheting and my grandmother was not sewing something for my dolls or for me. I think that the work in this class is going to bring a new aspect to my design approach and advance it to the next level that others in my field may not have, which will make me stand out to future employers.</h3>
